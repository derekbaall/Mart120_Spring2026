GUIs and CLIs
The difference between CLIs and GUIs is that CLIs, or Command Line Interfaces, are text-based and rely on commands being typed into the computer. CLIs are best suited for situations where precision and accuracy are required, like programming and automation. GLIs are more accessible since they use visual elements such as mice and pointers, icons, tabs, and scroll bars. These make using computers easy and straightforward, and you don't need to type anything in if you want to access what's on your screen. Some pros of the command line interface are that it uses less processing power, it's more precise than GUIs, and it's also faster. A few pros of GUIs are that they're very customizable visually, they allow for easy multitasking, and they reduce typing errors.
